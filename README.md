#Waf-launcher
This is a simple wrapper for the 
[waf build system](http://code.google.com/p/waf/)

Since many windows users does not have python installed by default, 
the exe file from this project can be included along with the copy of 
waf to wrap waf to install python on demand.

The requirements is only .Net 2.0 whics is either Windows Server 2003 R2 
and up, or Windows Vista and up. There is a good chance it is installed 
in many OEM installs of Windows XP as well
